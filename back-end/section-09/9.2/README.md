     - sumAverageGrade: returns the average grade of the student person
     - generateEnrollment: returns a unique generated string
       as enrollment for student person
`Validations`:
     - Registration number must be at least 16 characters long
     - The student must have a maximum of 4 test scores
     - The student person must have a maximum of 2 grades of work

     - registration: registration number
     - salary: salary amount
